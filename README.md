# MinecraftTestmod for Forge 1.17.1

## Overview
**Name of the Project:** Minecraft Testmod for Forge 1.17.1
**ModID:** testmod

This project is a test mod for Minecraft at version 1.17.1 (Forge) and is designed to expand my understanding and skills in Minecraft modding. The goal is to learn the basics and gain experience, that will be useful for developing, and releasing more extensive mods in the future.

## Functionalities

The main focus of this modification will be in the following areas:
1. **Block and entity creation**
2. **Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and their usage**
3. **New items including item functions**

## Installation (Without launcher like CurseForge)
1. download and install the latest version of Forge for Minecraft 1.17.1 from [the official Forge website](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.17.1.html).
2. download the modification by clicking on the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP". Unzip the ZIP file to any location on your computer.
Copy the mod files into the mods folder of your Minecraft installation. This folder is usually located in `%AppData%/.minecraft/mods` on Windows or `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods` on macOS.
Launch the Minecraft game with the Forge profile.

FYI: It's way easier with launcher like **curseforge**: [https://www.curseforge.com/download/app](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app)>
